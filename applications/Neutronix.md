### Project Details

> Neutronix enables rapid market entry for Metallicus by establishing a compliance-first, consultative channel to onboard Canadian credit unions to DeFi and RWA integration - driving MetalX utility and financial sector innovation.
> 
> The project is still in its infancy, but it draws on my own experience coordinating startups and businesses. My passion and deep understanding of Metallicus's value proposition allow me to say without a shadow of a doubt that I have the necessary skills to advance Metallicus' cause in Canada.

### Ecosystem Fit

> 1. Where and how does your project fit into the XPR Network ecosystem?
>   
>    MetalX is central to the project as the tokenized liquidity provided by Canadian CUs will be hosted on the XPR Network.
>    
> 2. Who is your target?
> 
>    Canadians CUs and other Canadian financial institutions because where there is tokenization to be done, Neutronix wants to help.
>    
> 3. What needs does your project meet for the community and what sets it apart from other similar projects?
> 
>    This is a broader intiative, in that it's a larger project aimed at attracting even more users and liquidity to the Metallicus ecosystem. This will benefit everyone, including $XPR, $MTL
>    and $METAL holders.

### Team

> This is a new initiative that will see the light of day if the project receives support from the community and, subsequently, from Metallicus. As the founder of Neutronix (Pascal Houde), a team of subcontractors will be assembled as Neutronix explores the field until it finds the necessary resources to hire employees for specific roles and functions. My main role will, of course, be to contact Canadian credit unions to raise awareness. At the same time, I will coordinate the initial steps by contacting all the authorities necessary to achieve the set objectives. Experts carefully selected by me will take over when specific accreditations are required. All advice from the Metallicus team will be taken seriously, and Neutronix will be happy to be at their dispoal, knowing that Metallicus has the required expertise and experience in the field.

### Additional Information

> I have immense respect for what Metallicus is accomplishing. XPR, and by extension, the entire Metallicus ecosystem, has gradually become my favorite crypto project. Metallicus is tapping into a unique niche market, which gives me confidence that Metallicus will continue its path to success and that Neutronix can be one of the Canadian subsidiaries that brings this exceptional product line to my home country.
